    IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY.

    This License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you (either
    an individual or a single entity) and Zumero LLC (“Zumero”) for the software
    product identified above which includes computer software (together with any
    updates or upgrades provided to you by Zumero) and online or electronic
    documentation and may include associated media and printed materials (“Library”).
    By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Library, you agree to be bound by
    the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this
    Agreement, do not install or use the Library.

    The Library is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as
    well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The Library is licensed, not
    sold.

    1. GRANT OF LICENSE

    Zumero grants to you a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive right to
    install and use one copy of the Library solely for the following purposes:

    a. You may use the Library for the development of a software application (“Licensee
    Application(s)”) that incorporates Zumero’s proprietary software contained in
    the Library.

    b. You may sell, license, and distribute any and all Licensee Applications that
    incorporate compiled elements of the Library.

    Zumero reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. 

    2. COPYRIGHT

    All rights, title, and copyrights in and to the Library (including, but not limited
    to, any images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and
    "applets" incorporated into the Library) and any copies of the Library are owned by
    Zumero LLC or its suppliers. The Library is protected by copyright laws and
    international treaty provisions. Therefore, you must treat the Library like any
    other copyrighted material, except that you may make one copy of the Library solely
    for backup or archival purposes. You may not copy the printed materials
    accompanying the Library.

    3. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS

    a. Except as expressly stated herein, you may not modify, adapt, reverse
    engineer, decompile, disassemble, rent, lease, transfer, sublicense, sell,
    assign or distribute the Library or any part thereof.

    b. Without prejudice to any other rights, Zumero may terminate this Agreement
    if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In such
    event, you must cease use of the Library and destroy all copies of the Library and all
    of its component parts.

    any part thereof), or process, or service that is the direct product of the Library
    to any country to which such export or transmission is restricted by any

    thereof and any losses, damages, fines, expenses (including but not limited to
    attorneys’ fees and costs), judgments, awards, or other liabilities or damages
    (a) arising out of or relating to any claims that your use or distribution of
